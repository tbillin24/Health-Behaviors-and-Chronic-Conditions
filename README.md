# Health-Behaviors-and-Chronic-Conditions

A Poisson count model regression using the 2017 US National Health Interview Survey show that health related behaviors have varying levels of success in reducing the likelihood in the number of non-transmissible chronic conditions. By decreasing negative health related behaviors such as smoking and BMI, increasing positive health related behavior like an individual’s physical activity, I find that the expected number of chronic conditions decreases. However, it was observed that alcohol consumption and light/moderate physical activity has a minimal effect on decreasing these chronic conditions. The results show that the health-related behaviors with the greatest effect on reducing the number of chronic conditions which should be the priority for a physician’s recommendation is that individuals should stop smoking and to increase the frequency of vigorous physical activity.
